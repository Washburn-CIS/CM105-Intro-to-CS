Quickstart
==========

Eager to get started? This page gives a good introduction to Flask.
Follow :doc:`installation` to set up a project and install Flask first.


A Minimal Application
---------------------

A minimal Flask application looks something like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import Flask
    from markupsafe import escape

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route("/")
    def hello_world():
        return f"<p>Hello, {escape(name)}!</p>"

So what did that code do?

1.  First we imported the :class:`~flask.Flask` class. An instance of
    this class will be our WSGI application.
2.  Next we create an instance of this class. The first argument is the
    name of the application's module or package. ``__name__`` is a
    convenient shortcut for this that is appropriate for most cases.
    This is needed so that Flask knows where to look for resources such
    as templates and static files.
3.  We then use the :meth:`~flask.Flask.route` decorator to tell Flask
    what URL should trigger our function.
4.  The function returns the message we want to display in the user's
    browser. The default content type is HTML, so HTML in the string
    will be rendered by the browser.

.. note:: HTML escaping

    When returning HTML (the default response type in Flask), any user
    input rendered in the output must be escaped to protect from
    injection attacks. HTML templates in Jinja, introduced later, will
    do this automatically. :func:`~markupsafe.escape`, shown above, can
    be used manually. It's omitted for brevity in the examples below.

Save it as :file:`hello.py` or something similar. Make sure to not call
your application :file:`flask.py` because this would conflict with Flask
itself.

To run the application, use the :command:`flask` command or
:command:`python -m flask`. Before you can do that you need
to tell your terminal the application to work with by exporting the
``FLASK_APP`` environment variable:

.. code-block:: text

    $ export FLASK_APP=hello.py
    $ flask run
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

If you are on Windows, the environment variable syntax depends on command line
interpreter. On Command Prompt::

    C:\path\to\app>set FLASK_APP=hello.py

And on PowerShell::

    PS C:\path\to\app> $env:FLASK_APP = "hello.py"

This launches a very simple builtin server, which is good enough for testing
but probably not what you want to use in production. For deployment options see
:ref:`deployment`.

Now head over to http://127.0.0.1:5000/, and you should see your hello
world greeting.

.. _public-server:

.. admonition:: Externally Visible Server

   If you run the server you will notice that the server is only accessible
   from your own computer, not from any other in the network.  This is the
   default because in debugging mode a user of the application can execute
   arbitrary Python code on your computer.

   If you have the debugger disabled or trust the users on your network,
   you can make the server publicly available simply by adding
   ``--host=0.0.0.0`` to the command line::

       $ flask run --host=0.0.0.0

   This tells your operating system to listen on all public IPs.


What to do if the Server does not Start
---------------------------------------

In case the :command:`python -m flask` fails or :command:`flask`
does not exist, there are multiple reasons this might be the case.
First of all you need to look at the error message.

Old Version of Flask
````````````````````

Versions of Flask older than 0.11 use to have different ways to start the
application.  In short, the :command:`flask` command did not exist, and
neither did :command:`python -m flask`.  In that case you have two options:
either upgrade to newer Flask versions or have a look at the :ref:`server`
docs to see the alternative method for running a server.

Invalid Import Name
```````````````````

The ``FLASK_APP`` environment variable is the name of the module to import at
:command:`flask run`. In case that module is incorrectly named you will get an
import error upon start (or if debug is enabled when you navigate to the
application). It will tell you what it tried to import and why it failed.

The most common reason is a typo or because you did not actually create an
``app`` object.

.. _debug-mode:

Debug Mode
----------

(Want to just log errors and stack traces? See :ref:`application-errors`)

The :command:`flask` script is nice to start a local development server, but
you would have to restart it manually after each change to your code.
That is not very nice and Flask can do better.  If you enable debug
support the server will reload itself on code changes, and it will also
provide you with a helpful debugger if things go wrong.

To enable all development features (including debug mode) you can export
the ``FLASK_ENV`` environment variable and set it to ``development``
before running the server::

    $ export FLASK_ENV=development
    $ flask run

(On Windows you need to use ``set`` instead of ``export``.)

This does the following things:

1.  it activates the debugger
2.  it activates the automatic reloader
3.  it enables the debug mode on the Flask application.

You can also control debug mode separately from the environment by
exporting ``FLASK_DEBUG=1``.

There are more parameters that are explained in the :ref:`server` docs.

.. admonition:: Attention

   Even though the interactive debugger does not work in forking environments
   (which makes it nearly impossible to use on production servers), it still
   allows the execution of arbitrary code. This makes it a major security risk
   and therefore it **must never be used on production machines**.
