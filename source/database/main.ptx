    <section>
      <title>Database Basics</title>
      <introduction>This first section will introduce you to writing basic database queries using SQL (Structured Query Language).</introduction>
      
      <subsection><title>Databases and database systems</title>
        <p>Before we start, we should define these two terms:</p>

<p><term>database</term>
    An organized collection of data.</p>

<p><term>database management system (DBMS)</term>
    The software that manages the storage of data in a database and provides facilities for searching, retrieving, and modifying data in a database.</p>


<p>The word "database" is frequently used as shorthand to mean both a database and the DBMS managing it, and both usages can be found in this textbook.  Also, "database system" is generally used as a synonym for DBMS.</p>

      </subsection>
      
      <subsection><title>Tables</title>
      <p>While relational databases can contain many types of *objects*, the object type that stores data is the *table*.  Each table in the database has a name, which usually provides some indication of what kind of data can be found in the table.  The table structure is defined by the table's *columns*, each of which has a name and an associated data type.  The actual data is contained in the *rows* of the table; each row is one data point and has a value for each column of the table.</p>

<p>We can visualize a simple table as, well, a table:

        <caption>Illustration of a table</caption>
        <image width="100%" source="database/table_illustration.svg"/>
    </figure>


The illustration above shows a table named <c>fruit_stand</c> with three columns named <c>item</c>, <c>price</c>, and <c>unit</c>.  Although the illustration does not show the data types, we might infer that the <c>item</c> and <c>unit</c> columns contain text and the <c>price</c> column contains decimal numbers.  Each row of <c>fruit_stand</c> contains information about one kind of fruit sold at the fruit stand.</p>
